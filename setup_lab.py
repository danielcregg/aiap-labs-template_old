# Task 1: Basic AI-assisted programming
# TODO: Create a function that greets a user by name
# Use GitHub Copilot to help you write this function


# Task 2: AI-assisted data processing
# TODO: Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns statistics
# Ask Copilot to help generate a function that calculates mean, median, and mode


# Task 3: AI-assisted class creation
# TODO: Create a simple Calculator class with basic operations
# Let Copilot assist you in creating methods for add, subtract, multiply, divide
# Use Copilot to suggest appropriate exception handling
